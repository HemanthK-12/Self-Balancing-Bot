# Self-Balancing Bot with Arduino

This repository contains the source code and resources for building a self-balancing bot using Arduino.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a self-balancing bot, a type of robot that can maintain its balance and upright position without falling over. It uses an Arduino microcontroller to process sensor data and control the bot's movements.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno or similar
- Gyroscope sensor (e.g., MPU6050)
- 2 x DC Motors
- Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)
- Battery
- Wheels and chassis

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino libraries: Wire.h, SoftwareSerial.h

## Setup and Installation

1. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries.
3. Load the provided Arduino sketch onto your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the bot is powered on, it should be able to maintain its balance and respond to changes in its orientation.
